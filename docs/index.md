This project primarily uses a C++ implementation of the MIT [video enlargement](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/) algorithm that runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and is easily extensible.

You can setup your own baby monitor that raises an alarm if your infant stops moving.

However, the monitor will not work as expected if the system is not calibrated properly.

If the system is not calibrated well or the environment in the video is not conducive to video magnification, you may not be able to use it.

## Getting Started

The baby monitor consists of two parts: baby monitor software and some simple hardware.
Learn how to use and recreate your own monitor in the following section.

### Software

To install prerequisites, build the software, or learn more about the software architecture, see [Software Installation Guide](setup/sw-setup.md).

### Hardware

To learn more about the hardware materials we used, and how we build our setup, check out the [Hardware Setup Guide](setup/hw-setup.md).
