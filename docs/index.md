This is a C++ implementation of the MIT [Video Magnification](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/) algorithm that is tuned to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and easily extensible.

You can setup your own baby monitor that raises an alarm if your infant stops moving.

However, the monitor will not work as expected if the system is not calibrated properly.

If the system is not calibrated well or the environment in the video is not conducive to video magnification, you may not be able to use it.

## Getting Started

The baby monitor is made up of two parts: the baby monitoring software and some simple hardware.
Find out all you need to know about how to use and recreate your own monitor in the sections below.

### Software

To install the prerequisites, build the software, or learn more about the software architecture, see the [Software Setup Guide](setup/sw-setup.md).

### Hardware

To learn more about the hardware materials we used, and how we build our setup, check out the [Hardware Setup Guide](setup/hw-setup.md).
