# 🛏️ Video-based baby monitor

**Video-based baby monitor** is a real-time embedded system based on Raspberry Pi, designed to monitor the sleep status of infants to ensure their safety. The system uses sensors to detect the infant’s movement, displays real-time data through a graphical interface, and provides alerts to notify caregivers of abnormal conditions.
